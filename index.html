<p>The Bhagavad Gita, a revered Hindu scripture, is a philosophical dialogue between Lord Krishna and Prince Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. It addresses the moral dilemma Arjuna faces about fighting in a righteous war. Krishna advises him on duty (dharma), righteousness, and the nature of existence, emphasizing the importance of selflessness and detachment. The Gita teaches the path of devotion (bhakti), knowledge (jnana), and selfless action (karma yoga) as means to attain spiritual liberation (moksha). Its teachings continue to inspire and guide people seeking inner peace and wisdom.</p>
